# Reflection – Daily Schedule Simulator
My approach for designing the schedule was to set the mood with emojis and different colors, it makes the simulation feel more put together. I chose real activities that I perform daily for the assignment, it was interesting to see my day to day life reflected in my work. One unexpected behavior that I encountered was when I didn't close the function by accident, the script failed to run altogether. This assignment teaches me how async code is useful unlike traditional scripts that run code line by line, it's great for setting timers to choose when your content appears. I added emojis, colors, and a surprise mood that appears in the middle of my script. This project is different from real word scheduling because it allows users to read the tasks one by one slowly, unlike real schedules that fill the screen with all its information at once, it could be overstimulating.
